<p><span class="smcap">In wanting</span> to bring you a distinctively
different Christmas greeting for 1953—as well
as one that is typically Texan—The Steck Company
turned quite naturally to Texas’ most distinguished
folklorist, J. Frank Dobie. His writings of the past
quarter century have turned the attention of people
in many lands to the rich folklore of the Southwest.
Dobie’s recollections of three boyhood Christmases
begin this volume. As an added fillip, his colorful
story of the Bowie knife is included.</p>

<p>Warren Hunter, one of Texas’ outstanding artists,
has provided striking illustrations that catch the spirit
of the stories and recall days quite remote from the
modern scene, yet separated from us by only a few
decades.</p>

<p>Thus, with a glance backward, The Steck Company
brings you warm greetings for the 1953 season. In
the words of Dobie, “Generous feelings and cheering
words are never trite. Merry Christmas!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It is</span> a benediction of nature
that generally we remember more vividly and
oftener what has given us happiness rather than
what has given us pain. Christmas in particular
is the time for recollecting, and now I am recollecting
Christmases even more remote in character
from modern Christmases than they are
in time.</p>

<p>We lived on a ranch twenty-seven horse miles
from our “shopping center.” That was Beeville,
Texas, which later became the family
home. Three or four times a year a wagon went
to town and hauled out supplies, but the biggest
haul was just before Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>As I look back, those days seem to have been
days of great plenitude—not because of anything
like family prosperity, for we lived meagerly,
but because of the necessity of local stockpiling.
Sugar came in barrels, molasses in kegs
or big jugs, flour in barrels or in tiers of 48-pound
sacks, beans and coffee in bushel sacks
(the coffee to be roasted and ground), lard in
50-pound cans, tomatoes, salmon, and other
canned goods in cases. Then at Christmas time
there was a large wooden bucket of mixed
candy—enough for us six children, for our visiting
cousins, and for the children of several Mexican
families living on the ranch, most of them
farmers. Each of these families received also
a new blanket and a sack of fruit.</p>

<p>We had home-made candy not infrequently,
but Christmas was the only time of year when
it snowed candy. There were no chocolates, as
I recollect—just a mixture of lemon drops and
an assortment of variously shaped hunks of
sugar, both hard and gummy, variously colored,
alloyed, and flavored, with peppermint being
dominant.</p>

<p>Christmas was also distinguished by apples,
oranges, raisins (on stems), almonds, walnuts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
pecans, and a coconut or two. We ate some of
the coconut as broken out of the shells, but its
main function was to be grated and mixed with
sliced oranges and sugar into ambrosia—as inevitable
for Christmas dinner as turkey is for
Thanksgiving. Nobody then dreamed of having
fruit every morning for breakfast. Oranges, apples,
raisins, and nuts were put into stockings
and hung on Christmas trees. They were a rare
treat.</p>

<p>These fruits and nuts left a stronger impression
on my mind than all other gifts associated
with childhood Christmases except books, firecrackers,
Roman candles—and my first new
saddle. There were tin bugles, toy trains, and
dolls for the girls, but we—the boys, at least—had
so much fun making our own toys that no
bought toy has left any impression on my memory.
Christmas was the time for new pocket
knives, and very useful they were. My father
taught us to whittle water-wheels, which could
be run only when an occasional rain made Long
Hollow run. The axle for the wheel might be
a piece of wood or a section of dried cornstalk,
less durable but much more easily fitted with
paddles than hard wood. The toy bugles would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
not split the air as brightly as cane whistles whittled
out of an old fishing pole.</p>

<p>We may have had colored balloons at some
Christmas, but I recollect only the ones made
from bladders. Hog-killing time is cold weather.
The chief prize for us from every hog and every
calf, cow, or steer butchered was the bladder. A
human mouth was the only air-pump for blowing
up this home-contrived balloon. Held, air-expanded,
near a fire, it would keep on expanding
until the material was very thin and dry.
Then came the climax—an explosion. Nobody
wanted to part with his bladder-balloon, but
that grand explosion could not be resisted.</p>

<p>I never heard of Fourth of July fireworks until
I was nearly grown. Firecrackers and Roman
candles were as much a part of Christmas as
ambrosia. The firecrackers could be set off by
day, but the Roman candles were for darkness,
when everybody watched the pyrotechnics. They
vanished all too quickly, like most other beautiful
things—but not from the great reality called
memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>There were toy pistols and airguns, but a
new pair of rubbers for a nigger-shooter gave
just as much satisfaction. At one time we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
more satisfaction from lead bullets gouged out
of live oak trees than from any other form of
shooting. Our house was on the edge of a grove
of scores of live oak trees, some of them very
large and old. When Uncle Ed Dubose, my
mother’s half brother, came in the fall to hunt
and again at Christmas time with all the family,
he freely spent ammunition perfecting his
marksmanship. His targets were tree trunks. He
was an indefatigable treasure-hunter also, but
he never found a bonanza comparable to that he
left us children in the form of lead.</p>

<p>From it, from solder melted off tin cans, and
from now and then a haul of babbitt found in
wornout windmills, we minted dollars. We
melted our metal in a large iron spoon over an
outdoor fire and poured the liquid into a round
wooden bluing box, wherein it quickly cooled
and solidified. (Bluing for laundry in those days
came in powdered form, for dissolving in water—in
wooden boxes, with tops that screwed on,
about the diameter of a dollar.) This free coinage
was limited only by the supply of crude
metal. The more canned goods we consumed
and the more old bullets we could find, the
higher the rate of coinage. The two principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
uses the dollars had were for pitching—into
holes in the ground—and for buying cattle,
horses, sheep, and goats from each other.</p>

<p>Each of us had a play ranch enclosed by miniature
fences—twine (our barbed wire) strung
on sticks stuck into the ground like posts. Our
cattle were tips of horns that had been sawed
off cattle at the chute in the big picket cowpens
about a hundred yards from the house. Our
horses were spools from which my mother and
neighbors had used the thread in endless sewing;
our goats were empty snail shells; our sheep were
oak galls. Sheep and goats were very plentiful
and, therefore, had a low value; cattle and horses
were harder to come by.</p>

<p>With running irons made of baling wire and
heated red hot in a fire, we branded the cattle,
sheep, and horses, but could not brand the snail-shell
goats. We made long trains of flat rectangular
sardine cans, coupled together by pieces
of wire, to haul the stock from ranch to ranch.
Our dog, Old Joe—named after Beautiful Joe,
the wonderful hero of a favorite book—made a
very unsatisfactory engine to pull the freight
train. We hitched green lizards, snared with the
hair of horsetail, to a single sardine can or to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
cardboard matchbox that served as a wagon.
Lizards never make tractable teams.</p>

<p>This ranching, with all of its ramifications,
was not primarily Christmas play. It went on
more in the summer than in the winter, but no
Christmas toys could compete with it. Certain
Christmas books added to prolonged play.</p>

<p>We children always knew positively that there
would be books on the Christmas tree or in our
stockings. We always wanted particular titles,
and we had the before-Christmas pleasure of
speculating on what known and unknown books
Santa Claus might bring. I don’t remember
what Christmas it was that <i>Ivanhoe</i> came to make
knights of us boys. Old Stray, an irritatingly
gentle horse that could hardly be forced out of
a walk, enriched the flowering of our knighthood.
<i>Swiss Family Robinson</i> made us into cave-dwellers.
We dug our own cave into the bank
of Long Hollow, some distance below the house.</p>

<p>I wasn’t yet reading when for Christmas I received
an illustrated book, with a linen cover,
about an owl that hooted. On demand my father
read it aloud over and over. We could hear owls
hooting in the live oaks many nights of the year,
and my father could talk owl talk. Every time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
he read the book he had to tell us what the owl
says, in words long drawn out from deep down:
“I cook for myself. Who cooks for you-all?”
There are very few conversationalists to whom
I had rather listen than to a hoot owl, and often
to this day his lonely and beautiful <i>who-ing</i> takes
me back to a Christmas of childhood, to a child’s
book, and to my father’s voice.</p>

<p>There were no commercial Santa Clauses in
the country, so far as I know. The only Santa
Claus for us was my father. At an early age I
learned his identity, but that knowledge had no
effect on the great illusion, any more than knowing
that a grown woman could not literally live
in a shoe had on the Mother Goose fact that
there was an old woman who lived in a shoe—and
she had so many children she didn’t know
what to do.</p>

<p>My father cut the Christmas tree out in the
pasture—a comely live oak or maybe a “knock-away”
(<i>anacahuita</i>)—and brought it in secretly.
After it was hung with gifts and lighted with little
colored candles and we had all gathered to
behold it, Santa Claus would bound in, all in
white and red, as cheery in his ruddy complexion,
reindeer country manners, other-world talk, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
contagious spirits as the Saint Nicholas of “The
Night before Christmas.” In disguised voice he
called out the names on the packages and added
joy to the gift in the way he presented it. Then
he would disappear, and presently Papa would
come in and claim his own presents with as much
eagerness as we had received ours.</p>

<p>“The gift without the giver is bare.” Gifts
can be manufactured, some beautiful, many useful,
but giving-out feelings can’t be—though
they can be cultivated. The love and cheer associated
with Christmas will always be the best
thing about it. How often just a good word that
conveys the word-giver’s generosity of spirit enriches
people! I remember the “Merry Christmas,
sir!” of a gray-haired woman scrubbing
stone steps at a college in Cambridge, England,
during the war; and recollection of her sturdy,
cheerful, kind nature brightens my world. I can
hear my mother’s “Christmas Gift” or “Merry
Christmas” as I write these words. Whoever
heard her greeting received a gift, for she meant
every syllable of it, felt every tone in it.</p>

<p>Sunrise, starlight, silence of dusk are never
trite. Generous feelings and cheering words are
never trite. Merry Christmas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In memory</span> as well as in actuality,
Christmas is the time for coming home. Many
a father lives for these homecomings of a scattered
brood, but it is the mothers who make
them. Fay Yauger’s “I Remember” suggests
something of almost universal contrast:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>My own mother has been dead five Christmases
now. She was eighty-seven years old when
she died and had been a widow for twenty-eight
of those years. Maybe every mother is a matriarch;
matriarchy was very strongly pronounced
in mine. She invariably wanted her children
and then grandchildren and great-grandchildren
home at Christmas, and they generally got there.
If I live to be a hundred, at every Christmas I’ll
be remembering the brightness of her face, the
eagerness of her greeting, the love in all her conduct—including
cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>There was a kind of homecoming in our family—the
returning of a presence without the
immediate returning of the person—that seems
to me to belong to Christmas, though it did not
actually occur at that season. Not long after the
United States entered the First World War, my
mother and father had three sons and a daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in the service. The baby of the family, Martha,
was still in school and so was Henry, the youngest
son, eighteen years old. My mother was thinking
how she would have him for a time at least,
as a stay while she cared for a sick husband and
her own aged mother.</p>

<p>During World War I, millions of youths who
joined the army volunteered. One day Henry
came to my mother and said, “Mama, I wish
you wouldn’t feel as you do about my enlisting.
I want to go. I feel like a slacker staying at
home.”</p>

<p>“Son,” she replied—and it was never her nature
to take all day to make up her mind—“if
you feel that way, go ahead and enlist. I’d rather
you’d go and never come back than stay home
feeling like a slacker.” Nor would it ever have
occurred to her to try to pull wires to get him
into a soft place.</p>

<p>Henry joined the Marines and within a few
weeks was across the Atlantic. He was the only
one of us four brothers who got a shot at the
Kaiser’s young Hitlers, but when he was fighting
in the Argonne, he wasn’t calling himself lucky,
I guess. In October, 1918, Mama had a letter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
from him and knew he was somewhere on the
front.</p>

<p>November 11 and the Armistice came. I had
been in France myself a few weeks at that time.
I can still hear and see the French peasants
around the artillery camp where I was stationed,
going about all day saying to each other and to
any American soldier they met, “<i>Fini le guerre,
fini le guerre</i>—The war is finished, the war is
finished.” Some had tears in their eyes. They
were in a kind of daze. They were in a transport
as if peace on earth and good will to all men had
suddenly arrived to end all wars. They were
kind and simple people, like the masses of people
of all nations, whether red, white, black,
yellow, or brown.</p>

<p>The Armistice had been declared and battling
had ceased. November passed, and no word from
Henry. Had he survived? One by one the days
of December passed and Christmas came, little
sister Martha the only child at home, and no
word of assurance from Henry and no dreaded
word from the War Department either. One
by one the long nights of January and the days
made longer by waiting for a letter that did not
come, passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Nearly every family in Beeville had a boy in
the service. A few were not coming back. Some
had come. The others had been heard from.
Everybody knew that Henry’s whereabouts were
unknown. The post office had been so besieged
over the telephone, every day and Sunday too,
with inquiries as to whether a letter had come
from this boy or that, the inquirers too eager
to wait for the mail, that the postmaster ordered
the phone taken out. He was a good friend of
my family.</p>

<p>One day in February, 1919, my mother answered
the ring of the telephone in her house.
A post-office clerk was calling. The postmaster,
he explained, had sent him across the street to
telephone from a store. The postmaster wanted
my mother and father to know that a letter had
just arrived—from Henry. Yes, from Henry,
postmarked U. S. Army of Occupation, in Germany.</p>

<p>With Mama and Papa in the house at this
hour were an infant grandson, lying in a baby
buggy, and his mother, Elizabeth, my brother
Lee’s wife, Lee being in the Air Corps.</p>

<p>“I can go faster than anybody else,” Elizabeth
cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_019.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>The post office was about four blocks away.
As she tore out, Mama and Papa followed as
rapidly as they could, pushing the baby buggy.
There was no pavement to roll it over. The
streets were sandy and gullied, but the baby
buggy was more than halfway to the post office
when Elizabeth met it coming back. She was
running, hand stretched out holding a letter that
had already been torn from the envelope.</p>

<p>There in the middle of the street the little
group read it through—a father enfeebled beyond
his years by a disease that was soon to carry
him off, a young kinswoman of eager sympathy,
and a mother, still wonderfully vigorous, who
had said, “Go, son. I’d rather you’d go and never
come back than stay home feeling like a slacker.”
I asked her years later for her definition of bravery.
“A brave person,” she came back, with steel-spring
energy, “is a person who is scared to death
and goes ahead anyway.”</p>

<p>I don’t remember now why no letter had come
from Henry. Anyway, a letter now brought him
home in safety and changed the world for a few
people who had been waiting in utter anxiety.</p>

<p>Many a man and boy, and many a woman and
girl too, had a strong affection for oxen reliabilities
bearing such names as Old North and
Crump, Tom and Jerry, Bigfoot Wallace and
Jim Bowie, Bully and Blackie.</p>

<p>Take Old Samson and the rollicky crew that
drove the freight train he helped pull. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
carrying supplies west from Jefferson on the
Louisiana line. The wagon to which Samson
was yoked happened to be loaded with bacon
and barrelled whiskey. One day he went lame.
The next morning a bullwhacker suggested that
he be shod with bacon rind. Accordingly the
rinds were cut off two sides of salt pork and put
on Samson for shoes. While he was being held,
the ingenious whacker suggested Samson would
feel more at ease in the strange footgear if he had
a dram. A quart bottle was filled out of a barrel
and poured down Samson’s throat. “Well, sir,
that old ox licked out his tongue and smacked
his lips and went against the yoke. For a while,
with his new bacon-rind slippers and morning
dram, he was as frisky as a young colt. He tried
to pull the whole load by himself.”</p>

<p>Some drivers of oxen were more noted than
the most noted oxen. Not long after Texas
joined the Confederacy, a youngster named Tim
Cude went from Live Oak County to enlist in
the Army. Although he was only sixteen years
old, his way with oxen was a community wonder—especially
the power of his voice over them.
It was a voice young and lush, but strong, without
the gosling quality. He did not charm the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
oxen by whispering—horse-charmer style—in
their ears.</p>

<p>Brindle and Whitey were his wheelers, Sam
Houston and Davy Crockett, the leaders. They
were steers of the old-time Texas Longhorn
breed, and they could pull a log out of its bark.
When Tim commanded them, they would go to
their places to be hitched to wagon or plow. Tim
was partial to Brindle, and when he put a hand
over the ox’s head, the ox would often show his
pleasure by licking out his tongue. The four
oxen were the last inhabitants of the little Cude
ranch that Tim told good-by when he left to
fight the Yankees. He was an only child. He did
not realize what emptiness he left behind him.
He seldom wrote to relieve it.</p>

<p>Months after Appomattox, his mother and
father learned that he was still alive at Lee’s
surrender. Tim Cude was a mature man now,
strong and rangy with a full-grown beard. More
months, then a year, then two years, dragged by,
and still Tim did not come home, and there was
no word from him. At first his father and mother
talked with high hopes of his coming. Then,
gradually, they came to saying little, even to each
other, about his return. They still nursed a hope,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
but the heavy conviction settled down on them
that Tim must be among the many other boys
in gray who would never come back home. Their
hope grew gray and secret, without confidence.
The days went by as slow as laboring oxen walk.</p>

<p>In the late spring of 1867 Mr. Cude put a
few beeves in a herd going north. Six months
later the owners of the herd returned and paid
him the first money he had seen in years. The
aging couple needed the money to buy necessities
with, but Mr. Cude had a hard time persuading
“mama” to go with him down to Powderhorn
on the coast for the purchases. “Tim might
come while we are gone,” was her only argument.
Mr. Cude’s argument that, if he came, he
would stay until they got back, had slight weight
with her. She wanted to be there. Mr. Cude
would not argue, not even to himself, much less
to her, that Tim would never come, but he often
reasoned gently that it was better for them both
to be resigned.</p>

<p>It was in December before Mrs. Cude finally
consented to go. They took a load of dry cow-hides
with them, and as the oxen pulled them
south at the rate of about two miles an hour, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
went over their plans again and again for spending
the money.</p>

<p>The plans cheered them. They would have
plenty of real coffee now, instead of tea from
parched acorns and corn, and a new coffee grinder
that would do away with the labor of pounding
the grains in a sack with a hammer. Their
old coffee mill was absolutely worn out. They
would get sacks of flour and have real flour bread.
“You remember how Tim always likes flour
gravy,” Mrs. Cude said. She would have enough
calico for three new dresses and a sunbonnet,
besides a tablecloth; he would have new boots,
new hat and breeches, and percale for sewing
into shirts. “I’ll get some blue for Tim,” Mrs.
Cude said. There would be a new plow for the
cornpatch and lumber for a gallery to the frame
house, so hot in the summer.</p>

<p>It took them five or six days to get down to
Powderhorn, and then two days to buy everything
and load the wagon. On the way back Mrs.
Cude kept wishing they’d make better time, but
the four old tortoise-stepping oxen never moved
a foot faster. “Perhaps Tim came home today,”
Mrs. Cude would say at the evening camp. “I
dreamed last night that he came just after dark,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
she’d say over the morning campfire, always
burning long before daybreak. In all the dragging
months, months adding themselves into
years, no day had dawned, no night had fallen,
that she had not made some little extra preparation
for her boy’s coming home. In all the period
of waiting, this was the first time she had not
been there to welcome him. As she approached
the waiting place now, the hopes of more than
fourteen absent days and of more than fourteen
absent nights were all accumulated into one
hope. Perhaps Tim had come. Mr. Cude shared
the hope, too, but it hurt him to see “mama
disappointed,” and he never encouraged day-dreams.</p>

<p>At last they were only six miles from home.
Christmas was only three days away. Then the
oxen stalled in a mudhole at the crossing on
La Parra Creek. For an hour Mr. Cude struggled
and worried with them, trying to make them
make the supreme pull. Mrs. Cude threw all her
strength on the spoke of one wheel. Finally Mr.
Cude began the weary business of unloading
some of the freight and carrying it on his back
out of the creek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Then suddenly they were aware of a man, dismounted
from the horse beside him, standing on
the bank just ahead. Being down in the creek,
they could not have seen his approach. His
frame, though lank, was well filled out, his face
all bearded, his clothes nondescript. In his posture
was something of the soldier. Nearly all
Southern men had, in those days, been soldiers.
For a second he seemed to be holding something
back; then he gave a hearty greeting that was
cordially responded to.</p>

<p>“Those look like mighty good oxen,” the
young man said, coming down, as any stranger
in that country at that time would come to help
anybody in a tight.</p>

<p>“They are good oxen, but they won’t pull this
wagon out now,” Mr. Cude answered. “I guess
they’re getting old like us. We been working
them since before the war.”</p>

<p>The stranger had moved around so that he was
very near the wheel oxen, which he faced, instead
of the driver and his wife. His hand was
on Brindle’s head, between the long rough horns,
and the old ox, whose countenance was the same
whether in a bog hole or a patch of spring tallow
weed, licked out his tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“I believe I can make these old boys haul the
wagon out,” the man said.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t do any better for a stranger
than for their master,” Mr. Cude answered.</p>

<p>“There’s only one person who could get them
to pull,” added Mrs. Cude. “That’s our boy who
went to the war.”</p>

<p>“Did he know oxen?” the young man asked
out of his beard.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, and they knew him. They liked
him.”</p>

<p>Then for a little while there was silence.</p>

<p>As Mr. Cude began drawing up his rawhide
whip, again the offerer of help, pleading now,
asked for a chance to try his hand.</p>

<p>“Very well,” Mr. Cude agreed slowly, “but
every time you try to make ’em pull and they
don’t budge the wagon, they’re that much harder
to get against the yoke the next time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>The young man asked the names of the oxen
and got them. Then he took the long whip, not
to lash the animals—for that was not the whip’s
function—but to pop it. He swung it lightly
and tested the popper three or four times, as if
getting back the feel of something long familiar
that had been laid aside. Then he curved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
fifteen feet of tapering plaited rawhide through
the air—and the ringing crack made the sky
brighter. At the same time he began calling to
the oxen to come on and pull out. He talked to
Brindle and Whitey and Sam Houston and Davy
Crockett harder than a Negro crapshooter talking
to his bones.</p>

<p>The oxen, without a jerk, lay slowly, steadily,
mightily, into the yokes. The wheels began to
turn. The whip popped again, like a crack of
lightning in the sky, and the strong voice rose,
pleading, encouraging, confident, dominating.</p>

<p>The oxen were halfway up the bank now.
They pulled on out, but nobody was talking to
them any longer. No welcome of feast and fatted
calf ever overwhelmed a prodigal son like that,
initiated by four faithful old oxen, which Tim
Cude received from his mother and father on
the banks of an insignificant creek in a wilderness
of mesquite. All the gray in the world was
suddenly wiped out by sunshine, and all the
mockingbirds between the San Antonio River
and the Rio Grande seemed to be singing at
once.</p>

<p>The oxen, silent and slow, kept on pulling
down the road.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> long centuries of warring,
certain weapons of the Old World, like
King Arthur’s “Excalibur” and Siegmund’s
great sword “Gram,” became the subjects of
legends and of songs that have made them immortal.
Their solitary counterpart in the New
World, before six-shooter and law-abiding habits
supplanted its use, was the Bowie knife. The
knife’s origin is wrapped in fable as fantastic as
that recounting how the dwarf smiths forged for
the old Norse gods; its use is memorialized in a
cycle of dark and bloody legends yet told all over
the Southwest. And certainly the Bowie knife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
was once as important to the frontiersman as a
steady eye.</p>

<p>It was the rule to “use a knife and save powder
and lead.” The Bowie knife was the best possible
knife to use, and knife throwing and thrusting
were arts to be excelled in, as well as shooting
and wrestling. Indeed, many frontiersmen regarded
any other weapon than the knife, for work
in close quarters, as “fit only for the weakly.”
Bowie himself, it is claimed, could juggle a number
of knives in the air at the same time and at
twenty paces send one through a small target of
thick wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>For dozens of purposes the Bowie knife was
“as handy as a shirt pocket.” Its hard bone or
horn handle was often used as a kind of pestle to
grind coffee beans. The blade, sometimes as
heavy as a Mexican machete, served to hack limbs
from trees and to cut underbrush, as well as to
dress and skin game. Tradition has it that in
the battle of San Jacinto the Texans killed more
Mexicans with the Bowie knife than with bullets.
An Englishman named Hooten, who visited Texas
a few years after the battle and straightway
wrote a book, said: “I have myself seen skulls
of Mexicans brought in from the battleground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of San Jacinto that were cleft nearly through the
thickest part of the bone behind, evidently at one
blow, and with sufficient force to throw out extensive
cracks, like those of starred glass.”</p>

<p>Of all the characters connected with pioneer
history in the Southwest, James Bowie comes
nearer being unadulterated legend than any other.
He did nothing really great or constructive;
yet his name has probably been more widely
popularized than that of the truly great and
constructive founder of the Texas Republic,
Stephen F. Austin. He affected little, if at all, the
destiny of a nation, and merely a scrap of his
paper survives; yet the stories that sprang up
about him are second in number only to those
about the voluble and spectacular Sam Houston.
He is remembered popularly for three things:
first, his brave death in the Alamo, fighting for
Texas independence; second, his supposed connection
with a lost Spanish mine on the San Saba
River, which came to bear Bowie’s name, and
which today, after thousands of men over a
period close to a hundred years have vainly
sought to find it, is yet the object of ardent search;
third, the knife which bears his name—and
which, to many people, symbolizes his character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>All three of these claims to remembrance are
wrapped in legend. The traditional tales, some
of them truly extraordinary, centering around
the Lost Bowie Mine, would, if compiled, fill a
volume. History is clear as to Bowie’s part in
the Alamo, but the best stories about him there
do not get into documented histories. Nor do the
tales of how he succored abused slaves, took the
part of bullied preachers, and rescued wronged
women. But our subject is the Bowie knife.</p>

<p>The known facts about James Bowie’s early
life are that he was born in Tennessee in 1795,
two years later than his distinguished brother
Rezin P. Bowie, and that in 1802 he came with
his parents and their numerous progeny to
Louisiana. The name Bowie at that time was
already more than a century old in Maryland and
had been known for two generations in Virginia
and South Carolina, the several branches of the
family having shot out from a stout clan of Scottish
Highlanders. The male members of it—hard
riding, hard-headed, well propertied, decently
educated, contentious in politics, and
ready to die in adherence to the code of the
Cavaliers—generally deserved the epithet given
to them, “the fighting Bowies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>The pair that reared James were equal to
holding their own in a wilderness where turbulent
men were made more turbulent by the confusion
of land claims following the Louisiana
Purchase. On one occasion Rezin Bowie, Sr.,
father of James, in defending his land against
a gang of squatters, killed one of them. He was
arrested, charged with manslaughter, and put in
jail to await trial. Mrs. Bowie, accompanied by
a slave, rode on horseback to the jail, demanded
entrance, and entered. In a few minutes she and
her husband reappeared, each armed with a
brace of pistols. While the jailer retreated, they
mounted the horses in waiting and rode away.
It is not recorded that Rezin Bowie, Sr., was again
molested. Years later when this wife and mother
was told how her son had been killed by Mexicans
in the Alamo, she calmly remarked, “I’ll
wager no wounds were found in his back.”</p>

<p>In time, James Bowie and his brother Rezin
came to own and operate a great sugar plantation
on Bayou Lafourche, called Arcadia. Meantime,
John J., a third brother, had moved to
Arkansas and established a large plantation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>Jim Bowie was a man of surpassing vigor, of
headlong energy, and of great ambition to lead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
He was six feet tall and all muscle. He roped and
rode giant alligators for fun. Generally polite
and courteous, in anger he appeared “like an enraged
tiger.” He was somehow connected with
Dr. Long’s filibustering schemes against Mexico,
and with one or more of his brothers he seems
to have carried on an extensive business in slave
smuggling. The Bowies are said to have bought
blacks from the pirate Lafitte on Galveston
Island at a dollar a pound. On one occasion, says
the historian Thrall, Jim Bowie, while driving
ninety of his purchases through the swamps of
Louisiana, lost the entire band. Thereafter he
prepared himself against a similar disaster by
wearing “three or four knives,” so that he could
transfix any Negro that tried to run away. Jerking
a knife was quicker by far than reloading a
horse pistol at the muzzle. “Big Jim,” as they
called him, showed the “knife men” among Lafitte’s
crew several things in the art of knife
throwing.</p>

<p>And this brings us to our theme—a theme
concerning which history must stand abashed before
the riot of legend. Who made the first Bowie
knife? How did it originate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_041.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>According to an unpublished letter, written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
in 1890 by John S. Moore, grandnephew of
James Bowie, and preserved among the historical
archives of The University of Texas, the
original knife was modeled as a hunting knife
by Rezin Bowie, Sr., and wrought by his own
blacksmith, Jesse Cliffe. Some time later Jim
Bowie had a “difficulty” with one Major Morris
Wright, in which a bullet from Wright’s pistol
was checked by a silver dollar in Bowie’s vest
pocket. While Wright was in the act of shooting,
Bowie “pulled down” on him, but his pistol
snapped and the two foes parted, expecting to
meet another day. When Jim told his father of
this, the old gentleman got out his prized hunting
knife and presented it to his son with these
laconic words: “This will never snap.”</p>

<p>In the “Sandbar Duel” that followed, the knife
fully met all expectations. This duel was in
reality a free-for-all fight that took place among
twelve men who met on a sandbar in the Mississippi
River near Natchez, September 19, 1827.
In it two men were killed and three badly
wounded. Bowie was down, shot in four places
and cut in five, when his mortal enemy, Major
Wright, rushed upon him, exclaiming, “Damn
you, you have killed me.” Bowie raised himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
up and stabbed Wright to the heart. At once
Bowie’s knife became famous and copies of it
were widely disseminated.</p>

<p>According to notes kept by another scion of
the Bowie family, Dr. J. Moore Soniat du Fosset,
of New Orleans, now deceased, it was Rezin P.
Bowie, the brother of James, who devised the
knife. The occasion for it arose thus:</p>

<p>The Bowie brothers were very fond of riding
wild cattle down—a sport popular among planters
of Louisiana at the time. There were two
ways of dealing with the maverick animals. One
was to shoot them from horseback, as sportsmen
on the plains shot buffaloes; the other was to
ride against them and stab them with a large
<i>couteau de chasse</i>. Sometimes the cattle were
lassoed and then stabbed. The chase with knife
and lasso was wilder and more exciting than the
chase with pistol or rifle. Hence the Bowies preferred
it.</p>

<p>One day while Rezin P. was thrusting his knife
into a ferocious bull, the animal lunged in such
a way as to draw the blade through the hunter’s
hand, making a severe wound.</p>

<p>After having his hand dressed, Rezin called
the plantation blacksmith, Jesse Cliffe, and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
him that he must make a knife that would not
slip from a man’s grasp. Using a pencil in his
left hand, he awkwardly traced on paper a blade
some ten inches long and two inches broad at
its widest part, the handle to be strong and well
protected from the blade by guards. The model
having been settled upon, Rezin gave the smith
a large file of the best quality of steel and told
him to make the knife out of that. With fire and
hammer the smith wrought the weapon—just
one. It proved to be so serviceable in hunting,
and Rezin came to prize it so highly that for a
long time he kept it, when he was not wearing
it, locked in his desk.</p>

<p>Then one day Jim Bowie told his brother how
his life had been jeopardized by the snapping of
a pistol while it was pointed at a man firing on
him. After hearing the story and learning how
the final reckoning between the enemies was yet
to be made, Rezin unlocked the desk, took out
his prized personal possession, and handed it to
his brother with these words: “Here, Jim, take
‘Old Bowie.’ She never misses fire.”</p>

<p>Another story has it that in preparation for
the “Sandbar Duel” Jim Bowie himself took a
fourteen-inch file to a cutler in New Orleans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
known as Pedro. Pedro had learned his trade in
Toledo, where the finest swords in all Spain were
forged; and all his skill went into the making of
a blade which was to be, in Bowie’s words, “fit to
fight for a man’s life with.”</p>

<p>When in doubt, go to the encyclopedia. This
is what the <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i> (1928) sets
forth: “Colonel James Bowie is said to have had
his sword broken down to within about twenty
inches of the hilt in a fight with some Mexicans,
but he found that he did such good execution
with his broken blade that he equipped all his
followers with a similar weapon”—the Bowie
knife.</p>

<p>But let us not be too rash in drawing conclusions.
Arkansas is yet to be heard from, and
Arkansas has better right to speak on the subject
than any encyclopedia. The Bowie knife used
to be commonly known as the “Arkansas toothpick,”
and Arkansas is sometimes referred to as
“the Toothpick State.” Arkansians certainly
knew their toothpicks. The very spring that
Bowie died in the Alamo, Arkansas became a
state, and fittingly enough history records that
the members of the first Legislature used, after
adjournment in the cool of the evening, to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
their knives and pistols and repair to a grove
hard by, there to practice throwing and shooting
at the trees.</p>

<p>Some members of the Legislature were in fine
practice. The Speaker of the House was John
Wilson, sometimes known as “Horse Ears” from
the fact that when he was excited—whether by
love, humor, or anger—his ears worked up and
down like those of an aroused horse. One of his
political enemies in the House was Major J. J.
Anthony. When a bill relating to bounties on
wolf scalps came up Anthony arose and, in the
course of his remarks, made a cutting allusion
to Speaker Wilson.</p>

<p>With ears working and quivering “in a horrific
manner,” Wilson leaped from his chair,
drew a Bowie knife, and started toward his antagonist.
Anthony was waiting for “Horse Ears”
with his own knife drawn. A legislator thrust
a chair between them. Each seized a rung in
his left hand and went to slashing with his right.
Anthony cut one of Wilson’s hands severely and
in the scuffle lost his knife. Wilson, thereupon,
made short work of his enemy. In court Wilson
was triumphantly cleared of the charge of murder,
and at a meeting of the Legislature a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
years later drew his Bowie knife on another member.
Those were the days when the Bowie knife
governed in Arkansas.</p>

<p>So it is not without reason and just basis for
pride that Arkansas insists on having originated
the Bowie knife. It has already been said that
John J. Bowie established a plantation in that
state. A former Arkansas judge, William F.
Pope, maintains that Rezin P. Bowie once came
to Washington, Arkansas, and engaged an expert
smith named Black to make a hunting knife after
a pattern that he, Bowie, had whittled out of the
top of a cigar box. “He told the smith he wanted
a knife that would disjoint the bones of a bear
or deer without gapping or turning the edge of
the blade. Black undertook the job and turned
out the implement afterward known as the Bowie
knife. The hilt was elaborately ornamented with
silver designs. Black’s charge for the work was
$10, but Bowie was so pleased with it that he
gave the maker $10 more.</p>

<p>“I do not hesitate to make the statement,” concludes
Judge Pope, “that no <i>genuine</i> Bowie
knives have ever been made outside the State
of Arkansas.... Many imitations have been attempted,
but they are not Bowie knives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Despite such strong assertions, it would appear
that Judge Pope based his judgment on a
false premise. The classic Arkansas story comes
from Dan W. Jones, governor of Arkansas from
1897 to 1901. According to Governor Jones, the
James Black, who alone made the only “genuine”
Bowie knife, also designed it. Black was
born in New Jersey and, after having served as
apprentice to a Philadelphia silver-plate manufacturer,
came South in 1818, settling that year
at Washington, Hempstead County, Arkansas.</p>

<p>Here he found employment with Shaw, the
village blacksmith. Shaw was an important man
with high ambitions for his daughters. Consequently,
when Anne fell in love with the young
smith, only a hired hand, Shaw objected. The
young people married nevertheless, and James
Black set up a smithy of his own.</p>

<p>He specialized in making knives, and very
soon they had won a reputation. Governor
Jones’s story continues:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>“About 1831 James Bowie came to Washington
and gave Black an order for a knife, furnishing
a pattern and desiring it to be made within
the next sixty or ninety days, at the end of which
time he would call for it. Black made the knife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
according to Bowie’s pattern. He knew Bowie
well and had a high regard for him as a man of
good taste as well as of unflinching courage. He
had never made a knife that suited his own
taste in point of shape, and he concluded that
this would be a good opportunity to make one.
Consequently, after completing the knife ordered
by Bowie, he made another. When Bowie
returned he showed both the knives to him, giving
him his choice at the same price. Bowie
promptly selected Black’s pattern.</p>

<p>“Shortly after this Bowie became involved in
a difficulty with three desperadoes, who assaulted
him with knives. He killed them all with the
knife Black had made. After this, whenever anyone
ordered a knife from Black he ordered it
made ‘like Bowie’s’ which finally was shortened
into ‘Make me a Bowie knife.’ Thus this famous
weapon acquired its name.</p>

<p>“Other men made knives in those days, and
they are still being made, but no one has ever
made ‘the Bowie knife’ except James Black. Its
chiefest value was in its temper. Black undoubtedly
possessed the Damascus secret. It came
to him mysteriously and it died with him in the
same way. He often told men that no one had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
taught him the secret and that it was impossible
for him to tell how he acquired it.”</p>

<p>The death of the secret is a part of the story.
About 1838 Black’s wife died. Not long thereafter
Black himself was confined to his bed by
a fever. While he was down, his father-in-law,
who had all along been jealous of Black’s growing
reputation, met up with him and beat him
over the head with a stick. Probably he would
have killed him had not Black’s dog seized Shaw
by the throat. As it was, inflammation set up in
Black’s eyes and he was threatened with blindness.
As soon as he had strength enough to travel
he set out for expert treatment. A quack doctor
in Cincinnati made him stone-blind.</p>

<p>Black returned to Arkansas to find his little
property gone and himself an object of charity.
A Doctor Jones, father of the future Governor
Jones, gave him a home. When Doctor Jones
died, the blind man went to live with the son.</p>

<p>“Time and again,” recalls Governor Jones,
“when I was a boy he said to me that, notwithstanding
his great misfortune, God had blessed
him in a rare manner by giving him such a good
home and that he would repay it all by disclosing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
to me his secret of tempering steel when I should
arrive at maturity.</p>

<p>“On the first day of May, 1870, his seventieth
birthday, he said to me that he was getting old
and could not in the ordinary course of nature
expect to live a great while longer; and that, if
I would get pen, ink and paper, he would communicate
it to me and I could write it down.</p>

<p>“I brought the writing material and told him
I was ready. He said, ‘In the first place’—and
then stopped suddenly and commenced rubbing
his brow with the fingers of his right hand. He
continued this for some minutes, and then said,
‘Go away and come back again in an hour.’</p>

<p>“I went out of the room, but remained where
I could see him, and not for one moment did he
take his fingers from his brow or change his position.
At the expiration of the hour I went into
the room and spoke to him. Without changing
his position or movement, he said, ‘Go out again
and come back in another hour.’</p>

<p>“Upon my speaking to him at the expiration
of the second hour he again said, ‘Go out once
more and come back in another hour.’ Again
I went out and watched. The old man sat there,
his frame sunken, immobile, his only movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
the constant rubbing of his brow with the fingers
of his right hand.</p>

<p>“When I came in and spoke to him at the expiration
of the third hour he burst into a flood
of tears and said:</p>

<p>“‘My God, my God, it has all gone from me!
All these years I have accepted the kindness of
these good people in the belief that I could repay
it all with this legacy, and now when I attempt
to do it I cannot. Daniel, there were ten or
twelve processes. When I told you to get pen,
ink and paper they were all fresh in my mind,
but they are all gone now. My God, my God, I
have put it off too long!’</p>

<p>“I looked at him in awe and wonder. The
skin from his forehead had been completely
rubbed away by his fingers. His sightless eyes
were filled with tears and his white face was the
very picture of grief and despair.</p>

<p>“For a little more than two years longer he
lived on, but he was ever after an imbecile. He
lies buried in the old graveyard at Washington,
and with him lies buried the wonderful secret
of the genuine Bowie knife steel.”</p>

<p>Texas, too, has asserted her claim to being the
place where Bowie originated the knife. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
are other stories—many of them. However
they may contradict each other, the preponderance
of evidence goes to show that the knife used
by Jim Bowie in the “Sandbar Duel” of 1827 set
the fashion for Bowie knives. It was duplicated
in many places—by solitary smiths over a vast
pioneer country, by a factory in Sheffield, England.
It was improved upon and elaborated upon,
and until the six-shooter supplanted it, it was
the chief weapon employed to settle personal
difficulties over a vast territory of the South and
West where pioneer conditions prevailed.</p>

<p>The exact proportions of the original Bowie
knife probably never will be known, though the
blade was undoubtedly about ten inches long.
The <i>ideal</i> Bowie knife was forged from the best
steel procurable. It was differentiated from other
knives by having more curve to the blade near
the point, by having a heavier handle—often of
horn—and by having handle, blade, and guards
all so well balanced that the knife could be cast
a maximum distance with the most deadly effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>How many men Bowie killed with the blade
that saved his life on the Mississippi sandbar we
do not know. Rezin P. Bowie flatly affirmed that
the knife never was used more than the once for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
other than hunting purposes. Maybe Bowie used
at other times an improved model, though, as
we shall see, he was passionately devoted to “Old
Bowie.” Estimates of the number of men he
stabbed—exclusive of his work in the Alamo—vary
from sixteen to nineteen. It is significant
that Rezin was careful to make a distinction between
a “difficulty” and a “duel”; consequently
his flat assertion that neither he nor James “ever
had a <i>duel</i> with any person whatsoever” is to be
taken technically.</p>

<p>The technically trained Judge Pope, already
quoted, overruled, we might say, Rezin’s definition—or
assertion. “Several months ago,” he
records, “I met a descendant of the Bowies who
informed me that his great-uncle James once
fought a desperate duel with a Mexican with
knives, the combatants, face to face and within
mutual striking distance, sitting on a log to which
the stout leather breeches each wore were
securely nailed.”</p>

<p>Bowie was as gallant as he was gory. One time,
so another yarn goes, he met in Natchez-Under-the-Hill
a young man named Lattimore, whom
he recognized as the son of a much esteemed
friend. Young Lattimore had sold a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
amount of cotton and in a faro game was being
cheated by “Bloody Sturdivant,” a notorious
gambler.</p>

<p>“Young man,” said Bowie, “you don’t know
me, but your father does. Here, let me take your
hand.”</p>

<p>In a short time Bowie exposed the cheat. Then
he won back the money Lattimore had lost and
gave it to him with the advice to gamble no more.
“Bloody Sturdivant,” meantime, ignorant of who
his opponent was, had become so incensed that
he challenged Bowie to a duel, proposing that
they lash their left hands together and fight with
knives. Bowie accepted, at the first stroke disabled
the right arm of his antagonist, and then
forbore to take his life.</p>

<p>Duels of this character between men lashed
together were not exactly everyday affairs, but
the fact that they occurred at all bespeaks the
spirit of the times—and the popularity of the
Bowie knife. In the region of Texas below San
Antonio they were called “Helena duels” from
the fact that the town of Helena fostered them
rather frequently. Sometimes they were known
as “Mexican fights.”</p>

<p>More dramatic, perhaps, and certainly as chilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to the imagination, was another form of duel
that Bowie is said to have inaugurated. He was
challenged, so the story goes, and had the privilege
of arranging the combat. He stipulated that
the fight should take place at night in a dark
room into which the combatants, stripped to the
waist, barefooted—so that sound would not reveal
movement—and armed with Bowie knives,
were to be locked.</p>

<p>In the dead of the night they were accompanied
to the appointed room in a deserted
house. They entered. The door was locked.
The seconds outside listened for long minutes
without hearing a sound. Then they heard a
scuffle, accompanied by a click of steel, a moan,
and a voice crying, “Come in.” By the light of
a lantern Bowie was seen standing in a pool
of blood, the other man dead.</p>

<p>Bowie must have lain awake nights thinking
up novel ways in which to exercise his knife. It
is humiliating to record that in all likelihood he
did not think up what might be denominated
“the grave duel”—the most exquisite form that
hand-to-hand combat with knives could assume.</p>

<p>While the noted Clay Allison “of the Washita,”
one of the swiftest, boldest, most bizarre and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
humorous gunfighters of the Southwest, was in
Texas along in the early 1870’s he became embroiled,
so old-timers tell, with a neighboring
ranchman. The two men agreed to fight it out,
and the coolness and originality that Clay Allison
displayed in planning the details of the fight
would have delighted Jim Bowie.</p>

<p>“It was agreed,” Maurice G. Fulton relates
the story, “that a grave should be prepared of
the usual length and width, but to the exceptional
depth of seven or eight feet. The two men
were to strip themselves to the waist and then
seat themselves inside the grave at the two ends,
each grasping in his right hand a Bowie knife.
At a given signal they were to rise and start fighting.
This they were to keep up until one or the
other was dead. A final stipulation required the
survivor then and there to cover the dead one
with the earth removed in digging the grave.”</p>

<p>Clay Allison, of the Washita, threw in the dirt.</p>

<p>Bowie still had his knife at the Alamo—at
least a Bowie knife. Dallas T. Herndon, Arkansas
historian, says that he died in the Alamo “with
the knife made by James Black clasped in his
hand.” Others have said that around Bowie’s
cot—for he was ill—was a heap of Mexicans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
whose ribs had been tickled by the knife. Among
the relics in the Alamo itself at present is a not
very formidable specimen of cutlery that some
man by the name of Bowie donated a few years
ago as the original Bowie knife. The Witte Museum,
in San Antonio, has another knife that
is supposed to have been owned by Bowie and
presented by him to a friend. (Bowie seems to
have been fond of making presents of the knife,
very much as an author presents his own books.)
One tradition is that Bowie gave the original
knife to the great actor, Forrest. No doubt Bowie
admired actors. Another report has it that one
of the Louisiana descendants of Rezin P. Bowie
lost the original knife in a boggy river some forty
years ago.</p>

<p>James Bowie died before the knife that bears
his name was supplanted by the six-shooter. It is
generally said that Captain Jack Hays, of the
Texas Rangers, at the battle of the Pedernales
with Comanche Indians, about 1842, first fully
demonstrated the superiority of the Colt’s revolver
over all other weapons in close combat.
It was about this time that Robert M. Williamson,
a lawyer and one of the most singular characters
among the highly individualized men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Austin’s colonies, made a gesture that signified
the waning dominance of the Bowie knife.</p>

<p>The President of the Republic of Texas commissioned
Judge Williamson to go to a certain
county and there hold a term of court. No court
had been held in the county for years; the citizens
were principally engaged in feuds and
wanted no legal meddling. Just before court was
to be convened, a mass meeting of the feudists
adopted a resolution declaring that no court
should be held. When Williamson took his seat
on the bench, a lawyer who had been deputized
to set forth the resolution arose and read it aloud.
The courtroom was crowded with armed men.
After the lawyer had concluded and taken his
seat, the judge asked him if he could cite any
statute to warrant the adjournment of court for
any such reasons as he had set forth.</p>

<p>Coolly enough, the lawyer again rose, pulled
out his long Bowie knife, laid it on the table, and
said: “This is the statute that governs in such
cases.”</p>

<p>At this the fiery Williamson leaped from his
chair, drew one of the new Colt’s revolvers,
pointed it at the lawyer, and roared: “And this
is the constitution that overrides the statute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Open court, Mr. Sheriff, and call the witnesses in
the first case.”</p>

<p>Whether they be literally true or largely the
product of imagination—and many of them
must be fabrications—the tales that have come
down regarding the origin of the Bowie knife
and of its use by Bowie and other frontiersmen
reflect, in a phrase from Henry Adams, “what
society liked to see enacted on its theater of life.”
Indeed, they reflect not only what society “liked
to see enacted” but what was enacted. As truly
as documented history they reveal a time and a
people.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
